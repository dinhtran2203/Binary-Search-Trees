# Binary-Search-Trees
exercises your understanding of Binary Search Trees (multiply linked lists), recursion and simulation of recursion with a stack data structure in C++ 

P3 exercises your understanding of Binary Search Trees (multiply linked lists), recursion and simulation of recursion with a stack data structure in C++ 

Public methods to include:

            Constructor

            Copy Constructor

            Overloaded Assignment Operator

            Destructor

            Insert value (do not add duplicate values)

            Find key – returns bool indicating if value is present in tree

            Print ancestors – prints a list of all values on the path to the given value

            Find height – returns integer

            Post-Order Traversal done recursively (print key values to screen)

            In-Order Traversal done iteratively (print key values to screen)

                        (use STL Stack for this – see instructions on Canvas course site)

            Count leaves – returns number of leaves in tree

            Count full nodes – returns number of full nodes (nodes with two children) in tree

           

           

There will be additional private helper methods needed. The only methods that may print to the screen are the two traversals and the print ancestors.

Your driver should insert a minimum of 25 random* values to the tree. Test all the public methods of your class in the driver, printing the results to the screen. The user interface should clearly explain what is being tested and what results are expected.
